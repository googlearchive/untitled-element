## Getting Started

`untitled-element` represents a minimalist view on what Polymer team considers a basic component. If you prefer the minimalist approach, this is a fine starting point.

If you want a more fleshed out starter element, consider [seed-element](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html) to help get you rolling.
